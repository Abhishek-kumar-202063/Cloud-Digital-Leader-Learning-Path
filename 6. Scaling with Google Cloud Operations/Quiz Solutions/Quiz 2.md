## Which of these measures should be automated on a regular basis and stored in geographically separate locations to allow for rapid recovery from disasters or failures?
```cmd
Backups
```
## Google Cloud Observability provides a comprehensive set of monitoring, logging, and diagnostics tools. Which tool collects latency data from applications and provides insights into how theyâ€™re performing?
```cmd
Cloud Trace
```
## Which Google Cloud Customer Care support level is designed for enterprises with critical workloads and features the fastest response time?
```cmd
Premium Support
```
## Which metric shows how well a system or service is performing?
